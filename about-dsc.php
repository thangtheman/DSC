          <h3>DSC’s Message to the Nation</h3>
          <br/>
          <p>India has immense potential to rise up as a global super power. I strongly believe the youth of our nation will be the driving force to achieving this.  I take immense pride in being an Indian first, and I envision our nation thriving, against all odds. As a citizen of the nation, it is my duty and responsibility to work towards eradicating the challenges faced by my fellow citizens, which restrict growth towards rising up and shining bright globally.</p>
          <p> I have always advised the youth of our nation that their productivity and chances of achieving success substantially increase if honesty is the epicenter of their efforts. So with complete honesty and integrity, I take on the responsibility to prepare today’s youth for a better tomorrow. And I firmly believe that the time is now. It is time for the non-productive things like corruption and fraudulence to be wiped off completely from the nation. It is time to redefine the word politics for the nation. It is time to make public service the focal point of our attention. And for this to happen, we all must start NOW.</p>
           <p> It pains me deeply to see the opportunities missed by young and potential citizens of our nation, purely due to lack of confidence and determination. It pains me to see that there are still such heavy numbers of innocent lives deprived of basic amenities. Young and potential minds across the nation, especially in the rural areas are not being optimally utilized to uplift our nation. There is a strong lack of confidence, determination and most above a burning desire to contribute towards your nation. It is critical for the nation to come together and fight against these hindrances. One needs to create awareness amongst the youth to discover and nurture their true potential. If you have a strong determination and belief in yourself first, and then in your dreams,  there is nothing in this world that can stop you. </p>
         <div class="additional-info" id="t2"><p> As a responsible citizen of the nation first, and then as a leader, I have taken responsibility to bring about this level of awareness and change amongst society, especially the youth. I firmly believe that my experience, expertise and knowledge gained, empowers me to deliver. Having established what I have to date, I am now giving substantial time towards the socio-economic well being of society. But I surely cannot do this alone, and so I need your support and  participation. With this message, I appeal to the youth of our nation to rise up and be aware of your rights and responsibilities. Technology, the digital mediums like this website or the social media platforms, enables us to exchange thoughts and ideas, in making this nation a global super power. Let us together move this nation forward. I believe “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” which means the entire world is one family. And therefore we must work towards the betterment of the nation together. Our family needs us. Our nation needs us.  </p>
          <p>Let us begin by identifying problems across the nation, and by working towards finding solutions to eradicate them. Please write to me on <a href="mailto:onenation@dsc.com">onenation@dsc.com</a> and lets start this journey of a Better India!</p>
          <p> Yours truly,</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
