          <p> When it comes to making any major career decision, serious deliberation is in order. A decision that stems from any emotion is usually not as sound as one that is based on fact and reason.</p>
          <p>Then how does one make clear, effective decisions for one's career? How to address the resistance shown by our near and dear ones in our career choices?</p>
          <p>Do you ask 'questions' when your career desires are turned down? It is necessary to question and satisfy one's own curiosity and asking questions is a way of stepping the ladder of success.</p>
          <p>By questioning we not only feed our curiosity and build knowledge but also embrace positivity which helps in making better and informed decisions in life. If we refuse to question and stem our curiosity, negativity might creep in and drive positivity away.</p>
          <p>How does one take their ambition ahead when they meet with staunch opposition from one's parents?</p>
          <p>Parents look out for their children's best interests and perhaps identifying a 'tried and tested' career approach is a risk-free assurance in their opinion. Hence, one needs to convince them about the career opportunities and aspirations that are promising and go beyond the realm of 'tried and tested'.</p>
          <p>If one wants to succeed in something, one must keep trying and not lose focus. "Don't take 'no' for an answer. You attain failure in life, when you accept defeat. One shouldn't be afraid of a failure, because they are lessons in themselves. "A person's scars show how brave he/she has been."</p>
          <p>In order to make the right career choice, one has to examine and decide what factors are most important, and then choose the option that best addresses these factors. This operates on two levels - on a rational level and on an emotional level. One will only truly be happy with one's decision if these are aligned.</p> <hr/>
