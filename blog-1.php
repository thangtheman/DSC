          <p>It is always a matter of immense pride and pleasure to share moments of joy. Today, I want to share with you some good news for our Zee Family. I was privileged to receive the CIF Chanchlani Global Indian Award 2016. The award is result of the perseverance and hard work of our ZEE family around the world. I am extremely blessed to have such a dedicated team. When I was informed about this award, I was exhilarated for two reasons. One, of-course for being nominated to receive such a prestigious award; and two, for being able to represent my country at this esteemed forum. The word “Indian” written on this trophy makes me proud and happy more than anything else.</p>
          <img src="images/A1.jpg" class="pull-left" width="300">
          <p>People keep asking me the secret behind my success and my only response to them has been that the teachings which I have received from my grandfather are my biggest and most precious assets. They keep me focused on the path of truth determined to achieve set goals and most of all, they imbibe the “never give up” approach within me.</p>
          <p>The award reception also gave me an opportunity to meet interesting personalities such as the Hon. Kathleen Wynee, Premier of Ontario province and the Hon. Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. I had the opportunity to have some fruitful discussions with them and hope that those would help our Zee family and Indo-Canadian community come forward and support our work in Ekal Vidyalaya in Canada.</p>
          <p>Along with receiving the award, I felt extremely happy to provide the award money of $50,000 to Ekal Vidyalaya in Canada. I also had the chance to visit and meet some of the hardworking volunteers of Ekal Canada and spend some quality time with them. </p>

          <p>Ekal Vidyalaya is an initiative that I believe is capable of changing the face of our country. It is bringing pride back to the people of rural India by making them self-sufficient.  Ekal is helping create a solid foundation for rural India to grow and stay on their feet.</p>
          <p>I always say this, if you get a chance, do visit one of our Ekal Vidyalayas in rural India and you will understand the difference and the harmonious atmosphere there.</p>
          <p>I once again would like to thank the Canada India Foundation for honoring me with the award. This truly means a lot to me. I look forward to interacting with you all more with my blogs going forward.</p>
