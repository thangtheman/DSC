          <p>We think that our present era is an information age, but truth be told, we live in a communication age that brings the world closer with every given moment.</p>
          <p>But what is communication, really? Why is it important? Do we underestimate the importance of personal communication? Do we know how to overcome barriers to communication in our business and personal lives?</p>
          <p>Communication, in a way, means to participate. A good communicator can be a good leader. Simply put, communication is a process where we try as clearly and accurately as we can, to convey our thoughts, intentions and objectives.</p>
          <p>Communication is essential in every phase of life, especially in one's professional life. When we enter our   professional life, we immerse ourselves in the jargon and principles of our chosen field and obediently follow precepts laid out by our respective priesthoods. Yet rarely does one put serious effort toward expressing ourselves in a language that can be understood by those outside our tribe. Then we wonder why our efforts and achievements fail to resonate.</p>
          <p>Communication is not limited to boundaries, cultures and nationalities. ZEE believes in this dictum and creates quality, simple and relatable viewing content that transcends global languages, cultures and boundaries.</p>
          <p>Zee News - the first private Hindi News channel was created with an aim to broadcast the simplified version of the news content in the national language across the country. Even though I was met with initial criticism, I later received critical acclaim for this initiative.</p>
          <p>But is social media communication more effective than face to face or one on one communication? </p>
          <p>Communication gap results in generation gap. Technology might not be able to fill the generation gap. Parents may not be able to understand their childrenâ€™s behavioral patterns so the youth need to accept this. And elders need to understand that youth are ahead of their time.</p>
          <p>Communication can build bridges or break them. After all, what one needs to always remember is that good communication skills are the key to success in life, work and relationships. With the right communication one can reach higher levels of mutual understanding and cooperation while successfully attaining their goals.</p>
