          <p>We all hope for that extra hour and extra minute as we reflect back on our past. Since our childhood, we are reprimanded for not managing time well for work or play and then only realize the importance of time when we're about to miss an important flight or are running late for a life changing interview. Yet, there are many high achieving individuals who effortlessly and effectively manage time and have successes bestowed upon them time and again. How do they do it?</p>
          <p>The real question is, how does one effectively manage time? If we really calculate, we have very limited productive time. This productive time is the time frame where one gets tasks done. Even if 10% of India's population incorporates time management effectively, without doubt our country's GDP shall grow in double digits from the current 5-6%.</p>
          <p>Now, when one talks about time, we're reminded of being punctual. But is punctuality and time management mutually exclusive? Punctuality is an event of the life in management of your time. Whereas time management is a way of life. Indeed managing time effectively is for the long run and in order to reach oneâ€™s goal. Procrastination and unpunctuality can trigger a series of events akin to a domino effect that will cause undue stress and regard all future efforts as futile.</p>
          <p>When you fail to plan, you plan to fail' goes the proverb. Despite one's best preparations to stay well ahead of time, there can be certain exigencies one cannot control that may cause stress. Plan and execute ahead of time, and there would be no stress. Go to the source of the stress and nip it. Worrying about the past or the future causes stress; so be in the present.</p>
          <p>Time Management is Life management." - To manage time well-even for one's family-and work smart towards one's ultimate goal. After all, time is free, but is the most invaluable.</p> <hr/>
